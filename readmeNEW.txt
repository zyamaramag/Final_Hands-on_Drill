Good day! I am Gadiel Zya T. Maramag, from BSIT2-B1, I worked on the Memersala Flask Application.
These are the changes that I made for the Memersala Flask Application.
- Added a edit caption for the users that posted their own memes/images.
- Added a delete photo for the users that posted their own memes/images.
- Added a read function where you can click the photo to view the photo much larger.
- Added an option where users can choose if they want to upload a video or an image.

The app already had a CREATE function which led me to add the other functions.
